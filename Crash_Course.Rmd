Quick Introduction to R/RStudio

## Quick Introduction to R/RStudio

### R Programming Language

-   R is a freely available language and environment for statistical computing and graphics which provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques: linear and nonlinear modelling, statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, clustering, etc. (source: The Comprehensive R Archive Network)

## Quick Introduction to R/RStudio

### RStudio

-   RStudio is one of the most popular IDEs for R. It has a set of integrated tools designed to help you be more productive with R (and also with Python).

## A Typical Data Analytics Workflow

![](Data_Analytics_Worflow_Diagram.png)

### Import

-   Extracting the data from an internal database, a file, an online website, or thru a web application programming interface (API), to be loaded in R/RStudio

## A Typical Data Analytics Workflow

![](Data_Analytics_Worflow_Diagram.png)

### Tidy

-   Arranging the data into a neat data structure, with variable as columns and data points as rows.

-   Included in this step would be data cleaning, data augmentation, missing data imputation, and others

## A Typical Data Analytics Workflow

### Understand

-   Generally, the steps to extract insights from data after tidying up.

## A Typical Data Analytics Workflow

![](Data_Analytics_Worflow_Diagram.png)

### Transform

-   Processing the data in preparation for further steps. Examples are:

1.  Narrowing the data, e.g., by region or by age,
2.  Computing new variables, e.g., length of days until recovery, or delays in reporting cases
3.  Aggregating data, e.g., counting cases or solving rates/means

## A Typical Data Analytics Workflow

### Visualize

-   Plot data into graphs so that patterns and features may be explored and insights be extracted from what is seen.

## A Typical Data Analytics Workflow

### Model

-   When necessary, models help in summarizing the complex relationships and the patterns found from visualizations

-   Designing models for prediction or forecasting

## A Typical Data Analytics Workflow

### Communicate

-   Writing reports, creating dashboards, making presentations, compilations, etc.

### Program

-   All these processes to be encapsulated in a data science project plan

-   Possible to be encapsulated in one software, but it’s not impossible to use more than one depending on team members’ capabilities to process and analyze data.

A Crash Course Demonstration

## A Crash Course Demonstration

Data for Demonstration:

M Yasser H. Housing Prices Dataset. <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset>

## A Crash Course Demonstration

### Program

- upload the necessary packages
- pre-installation of packages should be done first

```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

## Preamble Code 

# install.packages("tidyverse", "knitr", "kableExtra", 
#                  "moments", "stargazer")

## Packages to Use

library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(moments)
library(stargazer)
```

## A Crash Course Demonstration

### Program

- below is a set of codes for me to compute descriptive statistics later.

```{r, echo = TRUE}

### generate basic stats

stat_vec <- function(x) {
  v <-as.numeric(x)
  vec <- c(mean(v, na.rm = TRUE), 
           sd(v, na.rm = TRUE), 
           skewness(v, na.rm = TRUE), 
           kurtosis(v, na.rm = TRUE))
  return(vec)
}
```

## A Crash Course Demonstration

### Import

- get the dataset from an online repository (Github)
- location of the file: https://github.com/pacayton/Crash_course_On_Data_Analytics/raw/main/Housing.csv

```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
housing <- read_csv("https://github.com/pacayton/Crash_course_On_Data_Analytics/raw/main/Housing.csv")
```

## A Crash Course Demonstration

### Import

```

## A Crash Course Demonstration

```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
summary(housing[,1:3])

```

```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
colnames(housing)
```

## A Crash Course Demonstration

### Tidy

- fix the data for easier processing later
- ex: price_in_thousands & with_parking

```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
housing <- housing %>% 
  mutate(
    price_in_thousands = price / 1000,
    with_parking = ifelse(parking > 0, TRUE, FALSE)
  )
```

## A Crash Course Demonstration

### Tidy

```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
head(housing[,c("price", "parking", 
                "price_in_thousands", "with_parking")])
```

comp_stats <- round(stat_vec(housing$price_in_thousands), 
                    2)

stats_table <- rbind(label, comp_stats)
```

## A Crash Course Demonstration

### Understand / Model

- we assume the following:

$$Price_\text{in thousands} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times area + \beta_2 \times bedrooms + \epsilon $$

```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.dim= c(4.5,2.5)}
linear_model <- lm(price_in_thousands ~ area + bedrooms, 
                   data = housing)
```


## A Crash Course Demonstration

### Understand / Model

- the result is:

```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
stargazer(summary(linear_model)$coefficients, 
          type = "text")
```

$$PredictedPrice_\text{in thousands} = 391.126 + 0.424 \times area + 739.566 \times bedrooms $$
